transaction_loader.py
----------------------
Week 3 Assignment — Python Exercise (P1)

Same all-or-nothing guarantee as SQL Q1, this time enforced from application code
instead of a single SQL transaction block.

Complete the load_batch() function below.

Requirements:
  - Load a list of trip dicts into the trips table
  - All rows must load inside a SINGLE transaction
  - If ANY row fails, roll back the entire batch (no partial commits)
  - Log what went wrong (which row, what error)
  - Return the number of rows loaded (0 on failure)
  - Never silently swallow errors — re-raise after rollback

The connection boilerplate and INSERT SQL are provided.
You write the body of load_batch() and main().

Test your function with:
  1. A clean batch of 5 rows — should commit and return 5
  2. A batch where row 3 has rating=99 — should roll back and return 0
     Verify: the DB row count is unchanged after the failed load.
